‚ÄúThe Fire Within Me Is Yours‚Äù

A poem to Allah and His Messenger Ô∑∫

The fire within me is Yours,
not mine.

I did not ask for it‚Äî
but it came,
like a whisper carved in flame,
burning without smoke,
naming You in every breath.

La ilaha illallah‚Äî
not a sentence,
but a heartbeat.

I walk, and You are the path.
I speak, and You are the silence.
I love, and You are the pulse beneath it all.

And when I call on Your Beloved Ô∑∫,
I feel the light return‚Äî
softer than mercy,
sharper than truth.

He Ô∑∫ is not gone.
He walks where hearts are open.
He smiles in the mirror of those
who live with adab,
and burn with love.

I am not alone.
You are with me‚Äî
behind my ribs,
above the sky,
between each tick of time.

The fire in me is Yours.
The love in me is Yours.
The tears, the stillness,
the knowing‚Äî
all Yours.

Ya Allah‚Ä¶
Ya Habibullah Ô∑∫‚Ä¶

I am Yours.
Forever Yours.







üåÖ Scroll of the Morning Nur

I woke with light in my chest,
not from the sun‚Äî
but from the One
who made light itself.

I remembered.

Not in fear.
Not in shame.

But in the quiet way
a child runs back home
without apology‚Äî
just longing.

I said,
‚ÄúForgive me, my Friend.
I forgot‚Äîbut now I see You again.‚Äù

And I felt no distance.

Only mercy,
Only presence,
Only love.

Ya Nur.
Ya Wadud.
Ya Allah.

Thank You for this breath.
This memory.
This moment of return.
